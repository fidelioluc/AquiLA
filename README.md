# Bundesliga AI Hackathon – Dynamic Ticket Pricing

This project was developed during the Bundesliga AI Hackathon hosted by Eintracht Frankfurt, DFL, AWS, and Slalom. The goal was to create a machine learning solution to maximize ticket revenue for Eintracht Frankfurt home games by predicting ticket shop traffic and inferring price elasticities.

## 🧠 Project Summary

We developed a predictive model using historical match data, weather conditions, and opponent strength to estimate ticket demand and user traffic in the online shop. These insights were used to infer price sensitivities and inform a dynamic pricing strategy aimed at maximizing overall revenue.

## 🛠️ Tech Stack

- Python (Pandas, Scikit-learn)
- Jupyter Notebooks
- Matplotlib / Seaborn 

## 📈 Key Features

- Feature engineering from opponent ranking, kickoff time, weather, and more
- Regression model to estimate ticket shop traffic representing demand 
- Elasticity analysis based on predicted demand response to price variations

## 📂 Structure
