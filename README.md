# Bundesliga AI Hackathon – Dynamic Ticket Pricing

This project was developed during the Bundesliga AI Hackathon hosted by Eintracht Frankfurt, DFL, AWS, and Slalom. The goal was to create a machine learning solution to maximize ticket revenue for Eintracht Frankfurt home games by predicting ticket shop traffic and inferring price elasticities.

## 🧠 Project Summary

We developed a predictive model using historical match data, weather conditions, and opponent strength to estimate ticket demand and user traffic in the online shop. These insights were used to infer price sensitivities and inform a dynamic pricing strategy aimed at maximizing overall revenue.

## 🛠️ Tech Stack

- Python (Pandas, Scikit-learn)
- Jupyter Notebooks
- Matplotlib / Seaborn (for analysis and visualization)

## 📈 Key Features

- Feature engineering from opponent ranking, kickoff time, weather, and more
- Regression model to estimate shop traffic and demand
- Elasticity analysis based on predicted demand response to price variations

## 📂 Structure

- `notebooks/`: Jupyter notebooks for EDA, modeling, and evaluation
- `data/`: Cleaned datasets used in the hackathon (if shareable)
- `models/`: Saved model artifacts (optional)
- `README.md`: Project overview and usage instructions

## 📍 Status

This is an active project – more improvements and model tuning to follow.
